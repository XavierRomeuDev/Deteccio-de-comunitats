# 🧩 Community Detection

This project implements a community detection algorithm from scratch in Java, as part of an academic assignment. The main goal was to develop and optimize a system capable of identifying communities within a network using graph data structures. 

The development process included the implementation of fundamental data structures, the design of the detection algorithm, its optimization to improve performance, and thorough testing to ensure correctness and robustness.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `.gitattributes`: Git configuration file.
- `build.gradle`: Build configuration file for the project.
- `src/`: Source code directory.
- `*.net`: Network data files used for community detection.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 8 or higher)
